### How to Start Contributing

If you don't want to work on the project yourself, you can help out a lot just by reporting any bugs you find or enhancements you want to see added!

Head over to [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/101zh/Timely/issues) to submit a bug report or let us know about a feature request!

First before working on any changes, please ask to be assigned to an issue that you or someone else has created. Once you're assigned please follow the instructions in ["Source Control"](#source-control) and have the tools available, listed in ["How to Start Working on This Project"](#how-to-start-working-on-this-project) to start making changes.

### How to Start Working on This Project
